# Meta
### Meta.
Do you want to create apps that will change the way people live their lives? How about products that are featured on Wired? Or maybe you just want to learn something new? Meta was made to help lower the extremely high barrier to entry for learning how to code and make game-changing applications.

### Is It For Me?
Meta isn't for everyone, but it may be for you if one of the following is true:
* You are thinking about attending a software development bootcamp and you want development practice,
* You want a cheaper alternative to a software development bootcamp,
* You want to learn something new that isn't taught in college but valuable in the job market,
* You work with or lead a team of software developers,
* You want to start a tech company,
* **You want to be a developer.**
